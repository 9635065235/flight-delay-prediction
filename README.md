# Flight Delay Prediction

This project aims to predict flight delays using historical flight and weather data. The project involves several stages including data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing raw, processed, and feature-engineered data.
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Directory for storing plots and notebooks.
- `data_collection.py`: Script for collecting and saving raw data.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
- `exploratory_data_analysis.py`: Script for exploring and visualizing the data.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Script for creating new features from the processed data.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the machine learning model.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/flight-delay-prediction.git
